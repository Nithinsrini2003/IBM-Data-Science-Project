This repository contains files and information about Data Science project on "Air Quality Analysis and Prediction in Tamil Nadu" which was assigned by IBM.
# Air Quality Analysis

This project aims to analyze air quality data, calculate average pollutant levels across different areas, and visualize the results. The dataset used for this project contains information about air quality measurements, including SO2, NO2, and RSPM/PM10 levels, in various locations.
## steps to install
- download the ipynb notebook for final code and visualisation
- open it in colab and upload the dataset csv file and rename it as data.csv
- Run the code with GPU

## Data Source
- The air quality data used in this project is sourced from the given dataset
# Usage
Start by loading your air quality data into the project directory.
Replace the "data.csv" placeholder in the code with the actual file path to your dataset.
Execute the Python scripts to preprocess, analyze, and visualize the data.
# Data Preprocessing
Data cleaning and preprocessing are performed to handle missing values and format the data for analysis.
Impute missing values with the mean of each column using the SimpleImputer.
# Analysis
The data is grouped by areas (City/Town/Village) to calculate the average levels of SO2, NO2, and RSPM/PM10.
Identify pollution trends and areas with high pollution levels.
# Visualization
Create visualizations, such as bar graphs, to display the average pollutant levels for different areas.
